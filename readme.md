React Project Collection

A collection of small React projects built as part of my learning journey. Each project focuses on mastering a different concept of React.

Projects Included

1. Custom React Component
A reusable component built to practice React component structure and props.


2. Digital Clock
A simple digital clock implemented using React hooks to manage state and lifecycle.


3. Background Color Changer
A project that dynamically changes the background color using React state and event handlers.


4. Props Example Project
A project focused on understanding and using props to pass data between components.


5. Vite Project Setup
A React project using Vite as the build tool, learning about faster development environments.
